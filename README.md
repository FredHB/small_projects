# Small Projects Repository
Includes smaller programming projects of mine, perhaps some paper replications.

## Choice Models
Multinomial choice models using normal and other mixture distributions. Code for maximum likelihood estimation and for dataset simulation in `R`.

## Mata Programming
Programming exercises in `Mata`, `Stata`'s matrix programming language. This includes:
  1. Regression command written up and implemented in Stata. 
  2. Olley and Pakes (1996) data simulator and estimator. Benchmarked against Rovigatti et al.'s `prodest` package for production function estimation.
